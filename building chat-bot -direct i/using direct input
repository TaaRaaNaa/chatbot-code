Assignment 3: Improve the chatbot's recognition capability

Step 3.1: Finding out what he / she wants
# Create training data

    "What do you want to eat tonight?",
    "I don't know what to cook tonight.",
    "Do you have any cravings?",
    "Can I get you something to eat?", 
    "What time will you be home?",
    "How much longer will you be?",
    "When can we expect you to get here?",
    "What's taking you so long?",
    "At what hour will you be here?"
    
]
training_intents = [
    "dinner_preference",
    "dinner_preference",
    "dinner_preference",
    "dinner_preference",
    "dinner_preference",
    "arrival_time",
    "arrival_time",
    "arrival_time",
    "arrival_time",
    "arrival_time"   
]
# this may take a couple of seconds
nlp = en_core_web_lg.load()
# Initialize the array with zeros: X
X_train = np.zeros((len(training_sentences), 
              nlp('sentences').vocab.vectors_length))

for i, sentence in enumerate(training_sentences):
    # Pass each each sentence to the nlp object to create a document
    doc = nlp(sentence)
    # Save the document's .vector attribute to the corresponding row in X
    X_train[i, :] = doc.vector
# Create a support vector classifier
clf = SVC(C=1, gamma="auto", probability=True)

# Fit the classifier using the training data
clf.fit(X_train, training_intents)

#Yes, a lot can be done here to check / improve model performance! We will leave that for another day!

Assignment 4: Add default
Assignment 5: Add variety to your answers, so he / she will think it's you
Assignment 6: Extract context from the sentence:
What day of the week is the question about?
7: Bonus Assignments
add variety to food
stem words in put text to improve recognition
combine patterns
ask for specification
Extra input for assignments
# add this to responses dict: "default": "I love you too!"
# in the predict function: if the model is not too sure about the intent, return the string "default"

    # If the maximum probability is low, one might say that the model is not sure about the intent
    # Note! This idea should work, but relies on the functionality of the predict_proba function:
    # for the SVC model, the predict_proba function does not give meaningfull results for small datasets:
